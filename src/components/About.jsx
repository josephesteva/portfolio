          <p>
            I'm a fullstack web developer based in the Washington DC area. I am passionate about finding efficient
            solutions to meaningful problems. I enjoy collaborating with a team to bring exciting applications to life.
            I love to spend time outdoors in my free time and am a fan of skiing, rock climbing, and mountain biking!
